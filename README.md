# DELHI METRO RAIL APP  

**Note:** This is NOT an Android application! 

This Java program, created by **Ridham Kumar**, allows users to input the source and destination stations of the Delhi Metro to calculate the shortest metro route and fare. The program also includes a metro map for better navigation.  

### Implementation Details  
The program uses data structures like **Graph** to represent the metro network.  
- **Nodes** represent metro stations, storing information such as the station name, corridor, and connecting lines.  
- **Edges** represent the distance between two stations, with the cost of an edge equal to this distance.  

Algorithms like **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, **BFS**, and **DFS** are used to determine the shortest path between two stations. The fare is calculated based on the total distance traveled. Finally, the program displays the route and total fare.  

### Key Files  
- `Map_main.java`: Contains the primary code logic.  
- `Heap.java`: Implements the heap data structure for efficient processing.  

### Requirements  
- Any IDE like Eclipse, NetBeans, or VS Code to run the program.  
- Basic knowledge of Java programming is recommended.  
- Familiarity with Graphs, Heaps, and algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS is helpful but not mandatory.  

For additional support, you can refer to resources like [Collections in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/).  

### Getting Started  
- Clone the repository to your local machine.  
- Open the project in your preferred IDE.  
- Run `Map_main` to get started!
